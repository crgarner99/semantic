          Computer science deals with the theoretical foundations of computation
          and practical techniques for their application.

          Computer science is the study of computation and information. Computer
          science deals with theory of computation, algorithms, computational
          problems and the design of computer systems hardware, software and
          applications. Computer science addresses both human-made and natural
          information processes, such as communication, control, perception,
          learning and intelligence especially in human-made computing systems
          and machines. According to Peter Denning, the fundamental question
          underlying computer science is, What can be automated?

          Its fields can be divided into theoretical and practical disciplines.
          Computational complexity theory is highly abstract, while computer
          graphics and computational geometry emphasizes real-world
          applications. Algorithmics is called the heart of computer science.
          Programming language theory considers approaches to the description of
          computational processes, while software engineering involves the use
          of programming languages and complex systems. Computer architecture
          and computer engineering deals with construction of computer
          components and computer-controlled equipment. Humanâ€“computer
          interaction considers the challenges in making computers useful,
          usable, and accessible. Artificial intelligence aims to synthesize
          goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making,
          environmental adaptation, motion planning, learning, and communication
          found in humans and animals.
