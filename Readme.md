Why should we structure HTML semantically for something like a login form?
It makes it easier for search enginges to scroll through the webpage and allows for those coding the website to find the relevant areas quicker becuase it is based on a naming schema vs div id.

What are some benefits of everyone using similar semantic HTML?
When everyone uses similar semantic HTML it makes it easier to understand what is being coded and to find areas with errors to fix. It is also easier on SEO ranking and website debugging because you can quickly find the area you want to work on or that the SEO is working to promote.

What are some disadvantages?
Some disadvantages are that your code could easily be read which would make it easier to alter for malicious reasons, and there arent semantic html tags for evertyhing you would want to do and still have the structure desired.
